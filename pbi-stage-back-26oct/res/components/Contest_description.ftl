<p>On January 7, we launched the Best Report Contest and asked our users to submit their best Power BI report. The entry period ended on January 29, 2016, and we selected the top finalists that tell their data story with originality and creativity, and display an effective use of Power BI. Now it’s up to <b>YOU</b> to pick the winner!</p>
<p>Let us know which report is the best by voting for your favorite between now and February 14, 2016. The first place report will receive $5000 from Microsoft and Power BI!</p>
<p>Click on the image below to open each finalist’s Best Report and see all of their information. If you would like to vote for that report, click on the “thumbs up” kudos button, located underneath the embedded report.</p>
